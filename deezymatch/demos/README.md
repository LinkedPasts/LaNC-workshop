## DeezyMatch demos

**Demo 1:** In this demo, we use an already trained model for the task of candidate ranking. As you will see, in the first part, we use a set of "static" queries while in the second part (i.e., candidate ranking on-the-fly), we will change the queries and find the candidates on-the-fly.

**Demo 2:** In this demo, we start with a (query-candidate pairs) dataset, train a new DeezyMatch model and use it for the task of candidate ranking.

To run the demos, you can either:

1. Use the Binder link: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/LinkedPasts/LaNC-workshop/HEAD?filepath=deezymatch%2Fdemos)
2. or manually install DeezyMatch on your machines ([see](https://github.com/Living-with-machines/DeezyMatch#installation)) and run the demos locally.
